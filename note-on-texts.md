Note on the texts
=============
The current texts were prepared by creating .txt files and pasting in the text from [State of the Union Addresses (1790-2006) by United States. Presidents](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5050) from Project Gutenberg online.

As many annual addresses were delivered in writing rather than verbally, some documents contain signatures. These have been omitted from the texts used in this project. Salutations ("Gentlemen of the House of Representatives") have been left intact.
