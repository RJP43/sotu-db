## Objective Statement:
Create a user-friendly interactive database of text documents from the State of the Union addresses through history. Allow users to search, compare documents, create visualizations, and perform computational tasks on the text.

## Project Goals:

-create site with full searchable text for all tier-one and -two documents

-web interface with a search box for finding phrases among all tier-one and tier-two documents

-create a TEI schema and encode tier-one documents

-use Processing to create visualizations with options to sort, color-code, and filter results

-integrate a way of visualizing the audience reaction to the speeches as given (when possible), such as showing which states have reps who gave standing ovations at which times, etc. If this is not feasible for one semester, at least have a way to visualize the political makeup of Congress at the time of the speech. 

-(stretch goal?) integrate analysis through R to enable users to perform analyses like HTRC right in the web interface

## Out of Scope:
-video or audio files of addresses

-public interaction like wikis, comments, etc

## Team:
-**Tyler Monaghan:** Project lead, Processing visualizations

-**Abdur Khan:** Project assistant, Python/R analysis

-**Tina Figueroa:** Project assistant, social media integration

## Schedule:
**Tuesday, Feb 13:** Project proposal complete, web presence established

**Tuesday, Feb 27:** Viable Processing tool for visualizing array data complete

**Tuesday, Mar 6:** Texts TEI encoded (minumum two full addresses)

**Tuesday, Mar 20:** Web search of texts functional

**Tuesday, May 1:** Final Exams -- Minimum Viable Product complete
