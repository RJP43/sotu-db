 So, I don't propose to reverse direction.  Complacency is not in our character -- not before, not now, not ever.
 And I ask the Congress tonight to approve several measures which will make budgeting more sensible.
Several principles describe the kind of America I hope to build with your help in the years ahead.
 And I will work to knock down the barriers left by past discrimination and to build a more tolerant society that will stop such barriers from ever being built again.
So, tonight I'm proposing the following initiatives: the beginning of a dollars 500 million program to reward America's best schools, merit schools; the creation of special Presidential awards for the best teachers in every State, because excellence should be rewarded; the establishment of a new program of National Science Scholars, one each year for every Member of the House and Senate, to give this generation of students a special incentive to excel in science and mathematics; the expanded use of magnet schools, which give families and students greater choice; and a new program to encourage alternative certification, which will let talented people from all fields teach in our classrooms.
 And let me be clear: This President will back up those who put their lives on the line every single day -- our local police officers.
But for all we do in law enforcement, in interdiction and treatment, we will never win this war on drugs unless we stop the demand for drugs.  And, my friends, we must involve ourselves, each and every one of us in this concern.
 And so, tonight I'm calling for the indefinite postponement of three lease sales which have raised troubling questions, two off the coast of California and one which could threaten the Everglades in Florida.
I'm directing the Attorney General and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to use every tool at their disposal to speed and toughen the enforcement of our laws against toxic-waste dumpers.
 The best answer is to make sure that a mess like this will never happen again.
 In light of the compelling need to reduce the deficit, however, I support a 1-year freeze in the military budget, something I proposed last fall in my flexible freeze plan.
 I detect a slight division on that question, but nevertheless -- [laughter].
 Never before in this century have our values of freedom, democracy, and economic opportunity been such a powerful and intellectual force around the globe.  Never before has our leadership been so crucial, because while America has its eyes on the future, the world has its eyes on America.
 The spread, and even use, of sophisticated weaponry threatens global security as never before.  Chemical weapons must be banned from the face of the Earth, never to be used again.  Our diplomacy must work every day against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
We must strengthen the alliance of the industrial democracies, as solid a force for peace as the world has ever known.
Tonight, almost half a century later, our peril may be less immediate, but the need for perseverance and clear-sighted fortitude is just as great.
